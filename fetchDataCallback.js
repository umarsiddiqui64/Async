/**
 * Debugging Notes:
 * 
 * Problem:
 * - The fetchDataWithCallback function intermittently failed due to inconsistent error handling.
 * - Random failures were simulated but not properly passed to the callback.
 * 
 * Root Cause:
 * - The callback didn't clearly differentiate between success and error states.
 * - Errors were not consistently handled, leading to unexpected behavior.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * - Introduced proper error handling using an `if-else` block.
 * - Ensured that the callback is invoked with clear arguments:
 *    - An error message if thereâ€™s a failure.
 *    - Fetched data if the request is successful.
 * 
 * Validation:
 * - Tested multiple runs to ensure consistent behavior.
 * - Confirmed that "Error fetching data" is logged for failures.
 * - Verified that correct data is logged for successes.
